**Life is not black and white; there is some gray nuance to it**
## Procedure
* Install [python](https://www.python.org/) to your computer
* Install [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  * `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
  * `python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow`
* Unzip the minecraft ressource pack you want to edit
* Run [app.py](https://github.com/Wylarel/Graycraft/blob/master/app.py) in the ressource pack folder
* Zip the folder to a new ressource pack
## Notes
*It is probably possible to use MCPatcher and optifine to modify many more hardcoded values, like for example the water color, the sky color, the redstone... If someone knows how to do it, they can contact me or directly make a pull request.*
  
*It would probably be much more efficient and easy to make a shader that desaturates the whole rendering.*
